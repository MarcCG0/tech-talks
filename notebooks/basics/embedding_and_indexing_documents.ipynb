Some embrace it, some fear it, but most people accept it as a tool- a means to an end- and a way to make life easier. This tool most notably affects the lives of the youngest generation, since they grew up surrounded by screens. Texting, typing, and searching are all second nature to Generation Z. As \"Gen Z\" grows, the world grows around it, moving and adapting with an increased reliability on technology. New traditions, inventions, and methods rise to meet a technologically advanced society. In schools, (the territory of Gen Z), there is an influx of \\'distance learning,\\' or online classes. These courses are an amazing benefit to students because they offer a wider variety of subjects, cater to students\\' ambitions, and allow for students\\' physical limitations.\\n\\nAcross America, small, understaffed schools struggle to teach their students. While these schools can offer essential classes, such as academic English, history, sciences, and mathematics, some are unable to provide more flavorful classes like creative writing, human geography, or computer science. Some schools even struggle to teach advanced core classes, such as honors, IB, or AP. This is because such specific or advanced classes require qualified and specialized teachers- a resource some areas simply do not have. This restricts these students, since they cannot take classes relating to their personal interests, or classes with college credit. Through distance learning, these students could have the opportunity to take classes their schools don\\'t offer. This benefit isn\\'t restricted to underprivileged areas, however. Specialized teachers (or even professors) provide courses on a wide variety of interesting, challenging subjects that are not found in high schools, or even most colleges. Students can take online courses from influential entities like NASA and Microsoft, and earn college credit at the same time. Distance learning dramatically increases the scope of education and gives students learning opportunities they would not find otherwise.\\n\\nSome students have bigger goals than their schedules allow. In my sophomore year, I decided that I wanted to take AP Physics in my senior year. This meant that I had to take a physics course in my junior year, but I did not have enough room in my schedule, since I also needed to take economics to graduate, and I wanted to take chemistry. I notified my counselor and decided to take my Economics/Personal Finance class online, and free up an extra slot. In the spring of sophomore year, I was taking eight classes, instead of the standard seven. While this added to my workload, it enabled me to take both physics and chemistry in my junior year, and AP Physics my senior year. With distance learning, I expanded my schedule and took classes that interested me, and not just classes that were required.\\n\\nOutside of ambitions and location limitations, some students are physically unable to attend classes they enjoy. Life often takes control, and injuries or illnesses stop students from attending school, or taking more rigorous classes. My aunt has a physical illness that makes it very hard for her to attend stimulating events. Things like concerts, birthday parties, and movies all overwhelm her senses and cause tics and seizures. This manifested in her junior year of high school, and she was out of school for all of second semester. This would have severely harmed her chances of getting into college or graduating on time. Fortunately, she was able to get tutors and supplementary courses, so she was able graduate, and even got a large scholarship for her grades. Her last few years of high school were long and difficult because she could only learn when she was feeling well enough to interact with another person. Her illness dictated her schooling by limiting her ability to talk to people and listen to pages turn. Unfortunately, this was before online classes were widespread or accessible. If she had taken online courses, she would have been able to do work and study, even when she was unable to talk to people. Her same situation is reflected across countless lives- students\\' bodies are unable to handle the school environment, so they struggle to get the same education as their in-school counterparts. Distance learning helps to alleviate this issue by providing a self-paced environment with the same material, testing, and teachers, without the taxing physical environment.\\n\\nPerhaps the largest issue raised regarding distance learning is time management. Teenagers are notorious for procrastination, which leaves two options- easier courses or millions of disappointed parents. The self-paced nature of online classes provide seemingly endless opportunities to stave off work in favor of video games. However, this is a non issue. Students taking online classes face the same requirements as their in-school classmates, just through a different medium. While it is much easier to avoid work without a teacher present, students\\' grades will still reflect their effort and performance. Just like in a normal classroom setting, hard work is rewarded, and procrastination results in failure. Students using distance learning will effectively learn time management and responsibility if they want to succeed. If a student is likely to fail in an online class, they are just as likely to fail in a classroom setting. It\\'s all mindset.\\n\\nDistance learning is on a rise, fueled by a boom in technology. Some schools embrace it, and some reject it. Either way, distance learning is a huge benefit to students. With a longer list of course options, openings for schedule flexibility, and a broader availability to physically restrained students, online courses help students to learn and grow, and pick up good time management skills along the way.\\xa0'}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

However making it necessary for children to come to school teaches students independence and self-reliance, clears all distractions away from students by having them sit in a classroom, and allows time for students to ask teachers questions about topics that they do not understand before class begins, giving the student one-on-one time. Having students stay home, gives them no accountability besides to themselves, which does not guarantee attendance to school. Students can sleep in, not turn on their computers and no one is there to check them.\\n\\nHaving school online would not be beneficial to students.

It has become a part of everyday life for many American citizens, and a good number of people depend on them to carry out daily operations. Unfortunately, many of these daily operations occur while the individual is driving. As a result, many accidents have taken place in the last ten years due to the use of cellular phones while on the road.\\n\\nThis leads me to believe that if people can't concentrate on the road while talking on a cell phone, they shouldn't talk at all while driving. Rather than restricting access, the goal should be to provide in-vehicle information systems and safer means of using your cellular phone while driving. I understand that restricting cell phone usage while driving altogether isn't the best means for solving the problem.\\n\\nI do, however, believe that more safety precautions need to be taken for individuals who will be talking on their phones while driving. Phones are being created by Erricson, Motorolla, and Nokia today in which offer a hands-free cell phone so that you can keep both hands on the wheel while driving and talking. Some of these come in the form of headsets and give the user a voice-activated sequence, which allows you to talk into the speaker, and the number will instantly be dialed. Already this has eliminated the chance of your hands being off the wheel and having to do the act of dialing the phone. Both which allow you to keep your hands on the wheel and eyes on the road.\\n\\nEven hands-free devices that allow us to talk on the phone while driving with both hands on the wheel are still a hazard. Studies have shown that while talking to someone on the phone your brain is putting a lot of its energy into the conversation. This means that less of your brain is focused on driving the car. Yes, that could also mean a conversation with someone in the car is dangerous but you add in bad reception, how uncomfortable the hands-free earpieces are to wear and the annoyance of static or wind and you have a worse distraction.\\n\\nWhatever it is can almost always wait until you get where you are going. If it can't wait, you can always stop to look. Cell phone use should be banned for the safety of everyone on the roads. It may not be as convenient, but we won't lose nearly as many teenage lives to Tweets or texts if they know their license could be taken if they do look.         \"}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

Many accidents are caused because people try to read or respond to text messages while driving. Even when using a hands free device such as a Bluetooth, talking on the phone is still very distracting and causes the driver to pay less attention to other cars.\\n\\nAccording to the National Safety Council (NSC), \"Everyday 9 people are killed and more than 1000 people were injured in crashes involving distracted drivers\" (National Safety Council, 2019). In the same article, the National Safety Council said that \"drivers looking out the windshield can miss seeing up to 50% of what\\'s around them when talking on a cell phone\" (National Safety Council,2019).\\n\\nThe NSC also reminds people in the article that your mind can only process one task at a time, so you cannot talk on the phone and read a book at the same time (National Safety Council, 2019).\\n\\nThis is why even if you are using a hands free device to talk on the phone, the conversation is still occupying your mind while you are supposed to be focused on driving.\\n\\nMost states have fines for being caught texting while driving. If you are texting while driving and kills someone, you could be charged with vehicular homicide or manslaughter. If found guilty of these charges, you could spend a lot of time in jail. I think this is a really good law because even though it doesn\\'t stop everyone from texting while driving, it does stop some people who know this is a law and they could go to jail for breaking it.\\n\\nIn conclusion people shouldn\\'t be able to use cellphones in any capacity while operating a vehicle. Many people have lost loved ones and their own lives because of driving while being on their cellphones. Driving while texting and killing someone will put you in prison for a very long time.

Currently, if a student needs help with homework or a concept that they are struggling with, most often, they will have to come and see their teacher before or after school. Some students simply do not have that availability to see their teacher or are too embarrassed to ask their teacher during the class session. With classes being taken online, the student could simply email the teacher privately to work out a time to video conference their teacher for help. This simple interaction with teachers would show that students could go to their teachers more easily and would feel more comfortable when asking questions. With this increase of inquiries, scores in the grade book could go up, increasing parental and student satisfaction. Due to the introduction of online education, teacher-student interaction would become easier and more common.\\n\\nSecond of all, Students would be able to become build their technological skills parallel to learning new material. Many employers in this hyper-technological world are looking for employees that will be able to keep up with new technologies as well as help their business grow. While students are at school, they have access to technology, but this access is limited and most often very basic for most people. If schools' education was offered online, many students would rapidly become accommodated with new and more complex programs and applications. Teachers could require logging of time spent studying on spreadsheets, or taking screen shots of\\xa0research, as well as\\xa0making projects on three-dimensional design software for every student that they have. So many things in the classroom would have to be transferred online, making students who graduate highly valued to any employer looking to hire somebody. Highschool students who become adept at using online applications would be beneficial for a student and future employers.\\n\\nThird of all, any student that has to stay at home or be hospitalized due to a sickness would be able to continue their education. Throughout the year every school has a variety of issues, but one issue can truly devastate an education. If a student that is a tenth grader comes to school with what they think is a minor cold and goes about their entire day, many students would interact with this sophomore and soon all of these students would be home sick. Due to the transmission\\xa0those classes would only have half the students it should have. This issue is morbidly obvious. However true this issue is, disease cannot spread through technology. Any students taking these online courses would be safe from any other students who are sick. This would allow schools' education to run with a little more grease on their axles. Due to students having an online education many students who become sick would not have to pause their education for any amount of time.\\n\\nIn order to address those opposed, it is understandable for anyone to do so, but not forgivable. Many would say that the students would lose their friends, that they might become awkward, and that students might even cheat on assessments. All of these are understandable, but they are not without solution. Schools would be getting rid of their on campus schooling but would still host extracurricular activities and sporting events, along with gym classes, as well as dances and pep rallies. This would help retain student friendships at school. Students cheating on assessments has been a problematic in all school systems for years, writing on your arms and hands, looking at a friend's\\xa0paper to see which bubbles they filled in, or even feverishly copying someone's homework in the hallways outside of a class. While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well. Students could use their phones to search for answers to a variety of tests or share their answers with friends via text message. Their is no end to the creativity of someone who wants to cheat on an assignment, that is why a student's parent could supervise the student on each test and let the teacher know that the student was honest. This would be an easy way of reassurance for all instructors.\\n\\nIn conclusion, online school for students could be greatly\\xa0beneficial. Through one on one interaction with teachers, spurring more inquiries from pupils, becoming more proficient with technology at school and in the workplace, and allowing students who are afflicted with disease, and sometimes an injury, to attend school. Online school would benefit many students in this modern world. Now do what you think is right, go to a school board meeting, or sign a petition, because once we make this change, the Virginian education system will be stronger than any other state's. Now that isn't able to be said every day.\"}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

It was 1945, World War II had just ended in Europe, and countries needed help recovering from the war. To help these countries recover more than 44 countries joined together to make the United Nations Relief and Rehabilitation Administration or the UNRRA. This program hired \"Seagoing Cowboys\" (that\\'s what I was) to take care of the horses, young cows, and mules while the animals were on the ship. Don and I signed up of couse it sounded fun, and I had helped my Aunt Katie on her farm when I was a boy so I has some exspirence. Finally we received our orders to report to New Orleans, I couldn\\'t wait to go out and help people. We had arrived on August 14, that\\'s the day the Pacific war had ended. When we got our seaman\\'s papers we boarded to SS Charles W. Wooster, we were heading to Greece, I was so excited. In cargo we had 335 horses plus enough oats and hay to feed of the horses.\\n\\nI had turned 18 before I had arrivede at Gresse, so that meant I could be drafted for military service, but when my draft board had leanred I was on a cattle-boat trip be just told me to keep doing what I was doing. In the service you help people and help to fight for your country and if he told me to keep doing what I was doing that means I\\'m doing something that is going to help people in a big way. The cargo is going to help feed people in need because of the war destroying their food supplies. Not only did I help people, I also got to see Europe and China. Seeing the Acropolis in Greece was special. Also taking a Gondola ride in Venice, Italy was amazing too! The city with streets of water was beautiful. I also go to tour an excavated castle in Crete and marveled at the Panama Canal on my way to China.\\n\\nOn theses trips I got to meet new people and see new places. I got to help people in need, and that felt good. It feels good when you see someone that\\'s suffering because their home was destroyed and when you help them they have a smile on their face. Taking care of the cattle, horses, and mules was fun. We also found the time to have fun on board, especially on the return trips after all the animals had been unloaded. Us cowboys played baseball and volleyball in the empty hold where the animals were housed. We had table-tennis tournaments, boxing, reading, fencing, whittling, and games aslo helped us pass the time.\\n\\nThere are so many opertunities when you\\'re a Seagoing Cowboy. \"It opened up the world to me.\" \"It made me more aware of people in other countries and their needs.\" I took an offer of a life time, and you should too!

Teenagers are depressed, anxious, and some incredibly sick. It is so difficult to avoid some of the negative things in life when a student is constantly surrounded by peer pressure and bullying. If given the choice, many students would most likely choose to skip school and stay at home. However, if a student was given the option to attend classes from home, it would be beneficial. This is because\\xa0it allows those who get sick to stay caught up and protects those who get bullied and assaulted in school.\\n\\nFirst, online classes by way of video conference are very helpful to those who are sick because they are still able to be taught by a teacher. Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn\\'t miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren\\'t able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else. I got a very bad grade on the test on these concepts because I was not able to catch up. If I was able to call in to my missed classes, I would have benefited greatly because I could ask questions if I had any, hear the teacher\\'s explanation, and see how the teacher would solve the problem instead of having to figure it all out on my own. On a more serious level, there are some kids who are, unfortunately, terminally ill. They are either physically unable to go to school because of their type of illness or aren\\'t allowed to go out very often because of the risks and dangers they could face. They are more prone to your typical cold and flu, and it is deadlier for them. If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a \"normal\" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids.\\n\\nVideo conferences and attending classes online are also beneficial to a different demographic, those who are bullied and assaulted. To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn\\'t happen to them again. The book\\n\\nSpeak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn\\'t done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do.\\n\\nSome may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school. Whether it be in the neighborhood or at church, there are many other ways to get your social fix in. Take home-schooled kids, for example. They might be home alone all day trying to get their schoolwork done, but home-schooled students\\xa0have these groups called co-ops. These co-ops are groups of other students that are home-schooled that come to learn altogether. This helps those who are home-schooled get themselves some time with other students.\\n\\nThere are many benefits to having another option for students who are sick and kids who get assaulted and bullied. Many of today\\'s societal issues, whether it be new illnesses spreading or more and more students getting hurt and going to school in fear, affect a teenager\\'s school life. The less focused we are on the issues going on outside of school, the more we are able to focus on what could impact our future. School is vital to our future in today\\'s world, and the administration needs to realize that there are things taking away our focus from school. Teenagers are the future of this world, and the past generations need to realize that things are different that they were in their time. Would you want your children to go to school living in fear?
