# Instructions

Clone the repo and open the jupyter notebook at `playground/notebooks`. 

Set up your poetry environment and install dependencies: `poetry install` `poetry shell`.

Add your openai apikey at `secrets/openai_api_key.json` so that you can generate the embeddings.
A simple (and free alternative) is to use the python module `sentence_transformers`.

Note: Make sure that Python interpreter is using the correct environment.

Happy coding!
