Schools all around the world have weaved technology advancements into the classroom and outside of the class room to help get students more actively involved in school related activities and lessons. Technology is a blessing and curse, which means it helps teachers teach but also in certain aspects it worsens the attention span of younger children. Diving deeper into this world-wide technology advancement that is happening, there is this one main question that gets asked quite a lot by administrators all around the world, \"Would students work harder and better if they could attend classes from home virtually online or through video conferencing?\" My full opinion to that is, no. Studies show that almost 97% of people work better in a room full of other peers, although the isolation and focus you may have at your own home is nice and relaxing, in order for a person to fully develop into a knowledgeable student they have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning. You\\xa0can truly only achieve these three skills if you attend school physically, not virtually, that is why students would not benefit at all through at home learning than they would at school.\\n\\nIn order for all students to successfully climb up the social ladder, they need to have one major trait that can help all peers make connections, bonds, and even relationships, this skill is called social skills. There was a study done at Workman State College where scientist studied students who stayed home for the whole school day and then studied students who actually went to school for the whole day. Both groups of students were learning the same material, the group at home got a video of their\\xa0teacher explaining everything exactly\\xa0the same as\\xa0what she taught in class. Half of students at home did not talk to a single person the whole day that they were at home, meanwhile, the students at school had many conversations with other peers and teachers. Throughout the day, the students who stayed at home lost 10% of there overall social communication skills and did worse on a pop quiz about the information that was being taught by their teacher. This study exemplifies that if you were to stay at home and miss even just one day of school you would miss out on many social lessons like peer project and even just normal conversations that are experiences that can strengthen you socially for the future.\\n\\nWhile being at school you do not just learn about how to solve for \\'x\\' in mathematics\\xa0or who won the Mexican-American War, students subconsciously grow and learn more about their community throughout grade school. There is this whole other community aspect of learning going on that most do not even notice. What is truly important about getting up in the morning and going to a gigantic building filled with hundreds of people is that it is filled with family, friends, neighbors, and even strangers. Meeting all of these people and learning new things about them can really strengthen the school-wide community connections. Advancements with technology also help us by letting students connect with other people in their community, but technology also doesnt help us if we are letting students attend classes online through video conferences. Doing so would cause a major lack of enthusiasm and relationships within a community. Going home independently and working on classwork without getting the chance to learn about your teacher or other classmates through this safe environment at school, causes a total downfall on community awareness.\\n\\nGoing to school everyday and seeing you teachers and classmates is a prime and simple example of eye-to-eye learning. Eye-to-eye learning is basically being with another person in real life, not over a screen, and actually talking and learning form them. Almost every kid remembers at least one first day of school memory when they were little or even this past year. Well, that connection you made with other students and your teacher was an official eye-to-eye connection made. Unlike looking at a screen four hours on end while being taught, having the physical opportunity to talk to your teacher either in a whole class discussion or one-on-one is much more effective than an email or text message. There was a study done by the Freelance College in North Dakota, many certified scientist studied the difference between learning through videos on a screen at home or being at school learning through a teacher. Both groups were taught the same thing and took a ten question test\\xa0on the lesson that the teacher had taught. The statistics showed that students who stayed at home had a test average of 75%, while students who went to school had a test average of 97% The students who worked on the computer at home had a shorter attention span because their teacher was physically not at their\\xa0house teaching them, thus caused the at home students to do poorly on the test. Overall, this study clearly shows that students learn exceptionally better with eye-to-eye discussion in real life at school. Being able to communicate with a teacher one-on-one or in a class discussion really makes a positive change in the students academic performance.\\n\\nAlthough being at home is a quiet place to focus, in order for a student to fully develop into a successful person you have to have, social skills, community awareness, and be able to understand eye-to-eye learning. The way successors achieve these three skills easily is if you attend actual classes and school related events, students would not benefit anymore at home through virtual learning anymore than they do at school. Even though there are so many technology advancements, schools world-wide need to realize that many staying simple is better and that students must always attend classes in person in order to achieve greatness in the future   \\xa0 \\xa0'}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

Teachers wouldn't have to work as hard to figure out what he or she needs to do to help a student learn what they need to learn. This technology can tell what their emotional state is when in the classroom. If they are bored they might not like the way their teacher is teaching them. So the teacher can modify the way she teaches that specific lesson, so that the student has a better attitude toward that subject.\\n\\nThis technology can also help councelers talk to the students that might be having personal problems like bullies, or family issues at home. Kids wouldn't be able to hide their emotions as well with this techlology being in every classrom. For example with a false smile the mouth is stretched sideways using the zygomatic major, and another muscle called the risorius. You cant download the software on a normal computer, so schools would have to pay for the device its-self. It would be extremely expensive but it would help many students in classrooms, or some that need counceling.\\n\\nHumans perform this type of calculation every day, for instance when you ask a friend if they are ok, because they look depressed or angry. We can perform this calculation as accurately as the current technology we have now. For example Leonardo da Vinci used this type of calculation and knew exactly how her face needed to look in order to get the emotions he was looking for.\\n\\nIn conclusion this technology has many benefits for students and children that need counceling for personal problems, and or family problems at home.                                 \"}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

Some embrace it, some fear it, but most people accept it as a tool- a means to an end- and a way to make life easier. This tool most notably affects the lives of the youngest generation, since they grew up surrounded by screens. Texting, typing, and searching are all second nature to Generation Z. As \"Gen Z\" grows, the world grows around it, moving and adapting with an increased reliability on technology. New traditions, inventions, and methods rise to meet a technologically advanced society. In schools, (the territory of Gen Z), there is an influx of \\'distance learning,\\' or online classes. These courses are an amazing benefit to students because they offer a wider variety of subjects, cater to students\\' ambitions, and allow for students\\' physical limitations.\\n\\nAcross America, small, understaffed schools struggle to teach their students. While these schools can offer essential classes, such as academic English, history, sciences, and mathematics, some are unable to provide more flavorful classes like creative writing, human geography, or computer science. Some schools even struggle to teach advanced core classes, such as honors, IB, or AP. This is because such specific or advanced classes require qualified and specialized teachers- a resource some areas simply do not have. This restricts these students, since they cannot take classes relating to their personal interests, or classes with college credit. Through distance learning, these students could have the opportunity to take classes their schools don\\'t offer. This benefit isn\\'t restricted to underprivileged areas, however. Specialized teachers (or even professors) provide courses on a wide variety of interesting, challenging subjects that are not found in high schools, or even most colleges. Students can take online courses from influential entities like NASA and Microsoft, and earn college credit at the same time. Distance learning dramatically increases the scope of education and gives students learning opportunities they would not find otherwise.\\n\\nSome students have bigger goals than their schedules allow. In my sophomore year, I decided that I wanted to take AP Physics in my senior year. This meant that I had to take a physics course in my junior year, but I did not have enough room in my schedule, since I also needed to take economics to graduate, and I wanted to take chemistry. I notified my counselor and decided to take my Economics/Personal Finance class online, and free up an extra slot. In the spring of sophomore year, I was taking eight classes, instead of the standard seven. While this added to my workload, it enabled me to take both physics and chemistry in my junior year, and AP Physics my senior year. With distance learning, I expanded my schedule and took classes that interested me, and not just classes that were required.\\n\\nOutside of ambitions and location limitations, some students are physically unable to attend classes they enjoy. Life often takes control, and injuries or illnesses stop students from attending school, or taking more rigorous classes. My aunt has a physical illness that makes it very hard for her to attend stimulating events. Things like concerts, birthday parties, and movies all overwhelm her senses and cause tics and seizures. This manifested in her junior year of high school, and she was out of school for all of second semester. This would have severely harmed her chances of getting into college or graduating on time. Fortunately, she was able to get tutors and supplementary courses, so she was able graduate, and even got a large scholarship for her grades. Her last few years of high school were long and difficult because she could only learn when she was feeling well enough to interact with another person. Her illness dictated her schooling by limiting her ability to talk to people and listen to pages turn. Unfortunately, this was before online classes were widespread or accessible. If she had taken online courses, she would have been able to do work and study, even when she was unable to talk to people. Her same situation is reflected across countless lives- students\\' bodies are unable to handle the school environment, so they struggle to get the same education as their in-school counterparts. Distance learning helps to alleviate this issue by providing a self-paced environment with the same material, testing, and teachers, without the taxing physical environment.\\n\\nPerhaps the largest issue raised regarding distance learning is time management. Teenagers are notorious for procrastination, which leaves two options- easier courses or millions of disappointed parents. The self-paced nature of online classes provide seemingly endless opportunities to stave off work in favor of video games. However, this is a non issue. Students taking online classes face the same requirements as their in-school classmates, just through a different medium. While it is much easier to avoid work without a teacher present, students\\' grades will still reflect their effort and performance. Just like in a normal classroom setting, hard work is rewarded, and procrastination results in failure. Students using distance learning will effectively learn time management and responsibility if they want to succeed. If a student is likely to fail in an online class, they are just as likely to fail in a classroom setting. It\\'s all mindset.\\n\\nDistance learning is on a rise, fueled by a boom in technology. Some schools embrace it, and some reject it. Either way, distance learning is a huge benefit to students. With a longer list of course options, openings for schedule flexibility, and a broader availability to physically restrained students, online courses help students to learn and grow, and pick up good time management skills along the way.\\xa0'}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

Now this disease\\xa0has killed more people than influenza has this year. Epidemiologists for the CDC are recommending that colleges across the country shut down their campuses and revert to online school so that they disperse the student population to lower the chances of the students getting infected. This suggestion has been readily accepted in colleges throughout the country. Soon public schools could follow the colleges' lead. More and more public schools are introducing a plethora of online classes. Many students are now able to do classwork and take assessments online as well as conference with their teachers from the comfort of their home. Students would benefit from online school through more direct, one on one learning with teachers, building each students aptitude with technology for their future participation in the workforce, and allowing students with a variety of ailments to continue their education at home.\\n\\nFirst of all, with online classes students would be able to interact with their teachers on a more personal level. Currently, if a student needs help with homework or a concept that they are struggling with, most often, they will have to come and see their teacher before or after school. Some students simply do not have that availability to see their teacher or are too embarrassed to ask their teacher during the class session. With classes being taken online, the student could simply email the teacher privately to work out a time to video conference their teacher for help. This simple interaction with teachers would show that students could go to their teachers more easily and would feel more comfortable when asking questions. With this increase of inquiries, scores in the grade book could go up, increasing parental and student satisfaction. Due to the introduction of online education, teacher-student interaction would become easier and more common.\\n\\nSecond of all, Students would be able to become build their technological skills parallel to learning new material. Many employers in this hyper-technological world are looking for employees that will be able to keep up with new technologies as well as help their business grow. While students are at school, they have access to technology, but this access is limited and most often very basic for most people. If schools' education was offered online, many students would rapidly become accommodated with new and more complex programs and applications. Teachers could require logging of time spent studying on spreadsheets, or taking screen shots of\\xa0research, as well as\\xa0making projects on three-dimensional design software for every student that they have. So many things in the classroom would have to be transferred online, making students who graduate highly valued to any employer looking to hire somebody. Highschool students who become adept at using online applications would be beneficial for a student and future employers.\\n\\nThird of all, any student that has to stay at home or be hospitalized due to a sickness would be able to continue their education. Throughout the year every school has a variety of issues, but one issue can truly devastate an education. If a student that is a tenth grader comes to school with what they think is a minor cold and goes about their entire day, many students would interact with this sophomore and soon all of these students would be home sick. Due to the transmission\\xa0those classes would only have half the students it should have. This issue is morbidly obvious. However true this issue is, disease cannot spread through technology. Any students taking these online courses would be safe from any other students who are sick. This would allow schools' education to run with a little more grease on their axles. Due to students having an online education many students who become sick would not have to pause their education for any amount of time.\\n\\nIn order to address those opposed, it is understandable for anyone to do so, but not forgivable. Many would say that the students would lose their friends, that they might become awkward, and that students might even cheat on assessments. All of these are understandable, but they are not without solution. Schools would be getting rid of their on campus schooling but would still host extracurricular activities and sporting events, along with gym classes, as well as dances and pep rallies. This would help retain student friendships at school. Students cheating on assessments has been a problematic in all school systems for years, writing on your arms and hands, looking at a friend's\\xa0paper to see which bubbles they filled in, or even feverishly copying someone's homework in the hallways outside of a class. While online learning may be a good fix for a lot of these issues it could open up new problems as well. Students could use their phones to search for answers to a variety of tests or share their answers with friends via text message. Their is no end to the creativity of someone who wants to cheat on an assignment, that is why a student's parent could supervise the student on each test and let the teacher know that the student was honest. This would be an easy way of reassurance for all instructors.\\n\\nIn conclusion, online school for students could be greatly\\xa0beneficial. Through one on one interaction with teachers, spurring more inquiries from pupils, becoming more proficient with technology at school and in the workplace, and allowing students who are afflicted with disease, and sometimes an injury, to attend school. Online school would benefit many students in this modern world.

However making it necessary for children to come to school teaches students independence and self-reliance, clears all distractions away from students by having them sit in a classroom, and allows time for students to ask teachers questions about topics that they do not understand before class begins, giving the student one-on-one time. Having students stay home, gives them no accountability besides to themselves, which does not guarantee attendance to school.

This is because\\xa0it allows those who get sick to stay caught up and protects those who get bullied and assaulted in school.\\n\\nFirst, online classes by way of video conference are very helpful to those who are sick because they are still able to be taught by a teacher. Many students come into school even if they are sick. This causes an illness to spread around the entire student body just because one student couldn\\'t miss class. On the other hand, if a student stays home because they are sick, they miss a lot of classwork and aren\\'t able to pay attend the important lessons being taught. One time, I had to stay home because of a stomach bug. I got behind in my classes and was never really able to understand the concepts as well as I could have if I was taught by my teacher like everyone else.

If they were able to sit in on their classes through a video conference, then they could still feel like they are going to high school like a \"normal\" teenager. Overall, even if attending classes online was only available to those who are sick, it would still help so many kids.\\n\\nVideo conferences and attending classes online are also beneficial to a different demographic, those who are bullied and assaulted. To protect those who fear going to school because they are constantly putting themselves in danger, the school could give them this option of learning from home. There are so many stories of kids getting beat up at school and the school not trying to fix things or not being able to fix things, and this is a way that the schools can help be a part of the solution. There are also numerous stories of students getting sexually assaulted and raped. These students go through every day, trying to avoid those horrible people who did this horrible thing to them, wondering why they have to put in so much work just so this doesn\\'t happen to them again. The book\\n\\nSpeak brings a lot of light on this issue. The main character goes through this avoiding process and, in the end, is unable to completely avoid her rapist. She finds it extremely difficult to see him in school, acting as if he hasn\\'t done anything wrong. If she was given the option to do online schooling, I bet she would have done it in a heartbeat. She dreaded going to school every day and this extra option would have been a godsend for her. Sometimes, you have to take things into your own hands, and if that means making the decision to do schooling from home, then you do what you gotta do.\\n\\nSome may say that students and teenagers need a chance to socially interact with others, and school helps provide that. But, everyone has people they interact with outside of school. Whether it be in the neighborhood or at church, there are many other ways to get your social fix in. Take home-schooled kids, for example. They might be home alone all day trying to get their schoolwork done, but home-schooled students\\xa0have these groups called co-ops. These co-ops are groups of other students that are home-schooled that come to learn altogether. This helps those who are home-schooled get themselves some time with other students.\\n\\nThere are many benefits to having another option for students who are sick and kids who get assaulted and bullied. Many of today\\'s societal issues, whether it be new illnesses spreading or more and more students getting hurt and going to school in fear, affect a teenager\\'s school life. The less focused we are on the issues going on outside of school, the more we are able to focus on what could impact our future. School is vital to our future in today\\'s world, and the administration needs to realize that there are things taking away our focus from school. Teenagers are the future of this world, and the past generations need to realize that things are different that they were in their time. Would you want your children to go to school living in fear? Well, they already are.'}, vector=None, shard_key=None),\n",

Being able to succeed in an education from home is something that is often necessary. Being able to complete school work from home is helpful to not only students, but the school systems too. This way of learning makes sure students that are not able to physically attend school still get their share of education. Distance learning can be beneficial to students recovering from a major operation, or a severe social problem.\\n\\nSerious injuries happen involving students attending school more than you think. Some of these injuries require a major operation, causing the student to miss weeks of school and instruction time. Yes, parents can pick up the work that their child missed and bring it home, but doing this results in the child not knowing how to do the work. If they were not there when the lesson was taught, they would never be able to figure out the concept. If the student was told they would be out for 8 weeks due to surgery, they could quickly transfer to a distanced learning program. This way, they could video chat and speak to a teacher live. This would allow the student to get thorough instructions explained to them clearly, and help with any material they simply do not understand. Without this type of program, students would fall into a deep hole of confusion.\\n\\nAlthough everyone can get a little nervous in front of a large group of people, some people just cannot possibly function in large groups.

This would end the fears of students dreading to go to school each day. They could get their work done in peace, and not have thoughts of everyone watching them in their head. This would lead to them not getting easily distracted from education. Although, letting a student choose to avoid public school because of a social problem is not preparing them for the future; If the student does not focus in school due to the surrounding people, The good education they would get online is more important.\\n\\nWith reasoning as to why distance learning is beneficial, it should be looked at by more people and become a popular alternative.

However, attending class from home benefits students by\\xa0providing\\xa0more efficient learning experiences, allowing them to focus on what they love, and growing their time management skills.\\n\\nSchool from home is more efficient than a physical school. At my high school, there are breaks built into the day: seven minutes after class, 30 minutes for lunch, and 30 minutes to relax. Over an hour of the day is used that does not benefit the education of a student. The time that is used for these breaks would be eliminated if a student took their classes from home. A student taking the course online would finish with the same knowledge as a student that is not; however, they will finish faster. The elimination of unnecessary breaks makes the learning experience more efficient.\\n\\nAs the student has a more efficient learning experience, they have more time to do things they love. My friend Generic_Name, for example, is a Youth Olympics speed skater who has been taking online classes for four years. Taking online school provides Generic_Name the time to dedicate his efforts into speed skating. Without the opportunity of online school, he would not be as successful as he is now.

There was work due every week; however, all of the assignments were officially due at the end of the school year. Splitting up the work every week until the final deadline helped build the time management skills needed for success in the future. Additionally, the online course provided students with a general guide to split up work to help them manage their time. This helps build a foundation to grow time management skills. Online school, overall, has deadlines and tools that help a student build time management skills.\\n\\nOnline school is an opportunity that will help the student thrive.

The question is if their summer projects should be designed by the teacher or the student. I believe the projects should be designed by the teacher. The teacher has prior experience, more knowledge, and more time to design the project.\\n\\nIf the student is required to create this assignment, then they should be given preporation time during the school year to ask questions to see what the expectations are for the project.

They also have past experience with the summer project, so they know the most efficent way the project should be set up.\\n\\nIn order to design the summer project you would need plenty of time, which many students do not have extra time on their plates to handle the pressure of designing this summer assignment.

It would assure me that I would be learning everything correctly and take the pressure out of my hands.\\n\\nIf I had to design a project about a topic I knew nothing about, I would be put in a huge disadvantage. The teacher has more knowledge on the subject the summer project is on; therefore, they have a slight advantage. They will know how to word things properly and not over-simplify the directions. A student might make the project too simple and not take it too seriously. They will not have any supervision on the creating process and when school comes around their project might not be eligible for submission. When I had to do the summer enrichment packets for my advanced placement classes over the summer, I had no knowledge about the topics I was learning about.

Maybe thats because they dont know where to start other than,hi my name is ... i am .... i have ... my favorite... and so on. That kind of conversation can't go on forever, but if they have something to already talk about like basketball for example, you can go right off those starter sentences right into a real discussion. In middle school making connections and making friends is\\xa0just the start of what we are going to be doing it for the rest of our lives, so why not become good at it now.\\n\\nFinding something new\\n\\nMany students play sports outside of school like basketball,soccer,football, and more, but i'm sure most of them are good at more than just one thing. Thats where extracurricular activities can play a role. This gives students a chance to experiment and try new things that they think they might enjoy. If someone is a really good leader on the court or field, always cheering on a teammate or helping them out,then maybe they could do that for our school in the SCA. You don't even have to be good at something to try it out, extracurricular activities is a place to have fun learn new things and try new things. You never know if you will like it till you try it. The school offers many different activities and if you dont seem to find one you like there is always the option to start you own club. All you need to do is get a group of friends ( five or more) and a teacher to sponsor it. Being part of a team group or club can be good for anyone,and everyone, even if you already have a team, another cant hurt. So maybe this year try something new, be part of a different team, find a new group, or bring some good ideas too a new club.\\n\\nEntertainment after school\\n\\nThink about it. What do you do after school? I'm sure a lot\\xa0of you said I play video games,or I go on my phone,or I relax, and I'm sure there is a point when your like I'm so board. Well I have your answer. Extracurricular activity! Yep thats right,extracurricular activity is right after school so that means you dont need to be driven to the school after you already left, you can just stay for a fun filled time with others. This can be very good for a lot\\xa0of kids in many ways, because sometimes when students go home they stay on there electronics/ devices all the way till they have to go to bed! Sometimes even without a break. Thats no way to spend a day when you have a great alternet like extracurricular activity time. The best part is when you get home after your extracurricular activity and your parents tell you to do your homework ,or do some chores ,you can just say well I just got home from school and need some time to relax. This is also good for kids that just go home and hop on there devices/electronics,because there is not any real social aspect to that,no real human interaction which everyone needs. So try it our sometime, it can't hurt and maybe you will even really enjoy it.\\n\\nHaving a chance to making new friends with similar interest ,Find something new, and having after school entertainment is a very good thing that other schools should try for there students. Because it gives kids with no opportunity, opportunity, kids that need new friends, a chance to make new friends,and people who dont have anything to do after school something to do after school. There are also so many things and activities\\xa0to choose from you couldn't go wrong with any decision you make. This is why I agree with having after school extracurricular activities and I hope you do too.\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0   \\xa0   \\xa0\\xa0\"}, vector=None, shard_key=None)]"
